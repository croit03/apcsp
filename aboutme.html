    <p class="p"> I am a senior at Piedmont High School. Next year, I will be attending the University of California Santa Barbara. I will study the history of law and policy. I hope to one day be a lawyer to help others fight for their rights. Outside of law, I enjoy lacrosse, music, coffee, and hanging out with friends.</p>
